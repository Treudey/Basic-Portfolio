    <p>
      I am a passionate programmer out of Toronto looking to make a splash in
      the Web Development scene. I am attending the UofT Full-Stack Web
      Development Bootcamp and constantly adding to my portfolio.

      Ever since I printed my first “Hello World!”, I've gotten the coding bug
      and have dove in head first, immersed myself in the programming world.
      Every day I am trying to learn as much as I can about web development
      improve my skill set.

      I used to be an actor and I bring along my love of interacting with
      people and enjoy working in an environment with a strong focus on
      teamwork. I focus on building and maintaining strong relationships with
      my co-workers in whatever job I work at. I love to make my colleagues
      and employers happy by working extremely diligently and producing
      efficient and reliable work.
